## Introduction

Demo: [Be the Hero](https://seu-cantinho.web.app/)

Be the Hero is an web app sharing Non-governmental Organizations.

It is an SPA (Single Page Application) served by a RESTful API, using the stack: PostgreSQL + Express + React + Node.js.

This is the front-end side, made in React.

You'll need to install and run both the front-end and back-end (using npm or yarn) for making it work properly.

Back-end: [Link](https://github.com/pedrorfigueiredo/be-the-hero-back-end)

## Install

npm install
```

## Running

npm start
```

Now your Be the Hero is running at http://localhost:3000
